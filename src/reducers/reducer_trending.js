			description : 'Mosley, author of the celebrated Easy Rawlins novels, launches a new series starring Joe King Oliver, who was an NYPD detective until he was framed for sexual assault. Out of jail and getting by as a PI, Joe is reenergized when the woman who accused him of assault admits off the record to taking part in the frame-up. Mosley writes with great power here about themes that have permeated his work: institutional racism, political corruption, and the ways that both of these issues affect not only society at large but also the inner lives of individual men and women.',

			description : 'Chicago crime boss Darius Cole engineered Nick Mason’s release from prison, but, in exchange, Mason is now Cole’s designated killer. To escape this deal with the devil, he devises his exit strategy. The intensity Hamilton generates here feels like a like a wailing siren growing steadily louder. Noir is all about characters attempting to find options for themselves where none exist. The brilliance of this uncompromising novel lies in the way Hamilton, with the legerdemain of a master conjurer, turns despair to hope and back again, finally blending the two into their own unique nightmare world.',

			description : 'It’s rare for a writer to produce two career-defining masterpieces back-to-back, but that’s what Winslow has done by following The Cartel (2015) with The Force. In an era rife with racially motivated police brutality, Winslow examines what cops do right and wrong with clear-eyed realism and passionate humanity. The story of Denny Malone, who leads an elite NYPD task force, moves back and forward in time, showing how Malone’s assault on drugs and guns began as something good but eventually became something very bad. Grand in scope and equally grand in execution.',

The former Orphan X has cut his ties with the deep-cover Orphan Program and has reinvented himself as the Nowhere Man, helping those with nowhere else to turn. Now, though, he’s out to avenge the death of his former mentor, but can he do so without putting at risk a young woman he rescued from the program? The story moves as fast as a bullet train, and we’ve never seen Smoak as emotionally exposed as he is here. As the character of Smoak becomes steadily more complex, the humanity at the core of the man emerges forcefully.',

			description : 'Anna Johnson’s parents committed suicide within months of each other, but were the deaths really suicide? An anonymous note sends Anna on the trail of the truth, drawing retired detective into the hunt but then attempting to retreat when it looks like finding the killer will mean exposing family secrets. Mackintosh’s three bar-raising psychological thrillers have proven her adept at crafting compellingly flawed, authority-bucking characters and creating twists from the ripple effects of their relationships and personal issues.',

			description : 'In this stunning homage to James M. Cain, Lippman takes the mood and some of the themes from Cain’s classic noirs and brilliantly refashions them into a thoroughly contemporary story of a hard-luck woman trying to right her life by whatever means necessary. In this ingeniously constructed and extremely suspenseful tale, Lippman parcels out information slowly, allowing us to process one revelation before she confronts us with another. This is Lippman working at the height of her considerable powers.',

A U.S. senator needs that laptop back immediately, but Tanner senses his life will be at risk if he returns it. Finder shuttles between the points of view of Tanner and the senator’s chief of staff, with every move by one of the two creating more tension in the other. Great characterization, a plot that never flags, and even a few fascinating facts about coffee sourcing.',

			description : 'Like Laura Lippman’s Sunburn, Finn’s novel draws on classic source material—Hitchcock’s Rear Window—to craft an entirely original take on the theme of a housebound person armed with binoculars observing a murder. In this case, though, that person, Anna Fox, is agoraphobic and what she thinks she sees may or may not be real. As Finn gradually separates reality from illusion, bit by agonizing bit, the reader gives way completely to the turmoil in Anna’s mind. This utterly compelling psychological thriller makes Hitchcock’s plot—perfectly sane guy with a broken leg sees bad stuff and sorts it out—seem like child’s play.',
